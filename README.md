# Temporary Maintenance Fork: php-fhir-model Fixes

This repository is a **temporary fork** of the official `luscii/php-fhir-model` package.

I am using this fork to apply a critical bug fix required for my projects while awaiting the official update from the original maintainers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Included Fix

This fork includes a patch to address a compatibility issue with recent PHP versions:

### PHP Deprecated Notices for `jsonSerialize()`

**Problem:** Running the library on modern PHP versions (e.g., PHP 8.1+) results in numerous `PHP Deprecated` notices because the `jsonSerialize()` method in various classes lacks the required return type declaration.

**Correction:** The `jsonSerialize()` methods have been updated across all affected classes to explicitly include the **`: mixed`** return type, ensuring compatibility with the `JsonSerializable` interface and suppressing the deprecated notices.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING / TEMPORARY USE ONLY

* **Do NOT use this repository as a long-term dependency.**
* This fork is solely intended to hold the immediate fix and will **NOT** be actively maintained with new features.
* **Action Required:** Once the official `luscii/php-fhir-model` repository merges the fix and releases a new version, you must switch back to the original package immediately.
